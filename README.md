# CVPR_Research
Contributed to research enhancements for a CVPR-based detection and recommendation model. The system uses a multimodal approach that combines a text-based knowledge base with image classification for disease detection. Improvements included integrating automatic weight updates and preserving information from up to four previous layers to maintain contextual accuracy.
